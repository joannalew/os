Description: Create a small shell that works like the bash shell you are used to using, prompting for a command line and running commands. Allow for the redirection of stdin and stout, and support both foreground and background processes through command line and by receiving signals.

=======================
Instructions:
Enter the following bash commands:

1. run makefile by typing:
	make
2. execute shell by typing:
	./smallsh
3. enter shell commands such as:
	cd, status, cat, pwd
4. enter 'exit' to terminate the shell
5. (optional) type 'make clean' to remove extraneous files
